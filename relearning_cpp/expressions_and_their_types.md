# Expressions and their type
- Expressions
  - An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation
  - Expressions are fragments of the abstract syntax tree of the program
  - The evaluation of expressions generates two properties - **value category** and **type**
- Type property of expressions
  - Dropping of reference-ness
    - Expressions can have reference-ness in their initial evaluation
    - This is dropped before any further analysis
    - This is to support language semantics which allow objects and references to objects to be used identically
      - Unlike a pointer we don't have to dereference a reference
  - Dropping of top level cv-qualification
    - Top level cv-qualification is dropped for prvalue expressions of non-class non-array types
      - cv-qualification is important for const correctness of user defined types
      - In case of materialisation the cv-qualification of the prvalue can be relevant
      - Non-class non-array prvalue is treated as a true value that is not mutable
      - The `this` pointer is treated as a prvalue of type `X * const` and adjusted to `X *`
- Expressions and their evaluated object type
  - Result of evaluation of prvalue expressions is not an object, but an internal representation from which objects can be created
    - Temporary materialisation can convert a prvalue expression to an xvalue object
  - The result of runtime evaluation of a glvalue expression is an object
  - The type of this object usually has the type of the expression including cv-qualification
    - It does not in cases where a `reinterpret_cast` is used in the expression
    - ```cpp
      alignas(int) char y;
      int& x = reinterpret_cast<int&>(y);
      ```
    - `x` used in an expression will be lvalue of type `int`
    - Value of `x` will still be `char`
  - Objects are a runtime manifestation that depend on the program context
    - Methods like placement `new` can be used to layout objects in the space of other objects
    - Unions can be used to layout different objects in the same space, only one active at a time
- Dynamic type of an expression
  - ```cpp
    struct A {
      virtual int f() { return 1; }
    };

    struct B : A {
      int f() override { return 2; }
    };

    B b;
    A& a = b;
    int x = a.f();
    ```
  - In case of dynamic despatch the static type and dynamic type of an expression can differ
  - Static type of `a` is `A` but dynamic type of `a` is `B`
- Expression type and `decltype`
  - The type of an expression can differ from the `decltype` of the expression
  - The expression type rules are intended to ensure simpler evaluation
    - For evaluation an object and a reference to the object are equivalentÂ 
  - `decltype` is intended to be used for compile time type deduction
    - Reference-ness and cv-qualification are not ignored
